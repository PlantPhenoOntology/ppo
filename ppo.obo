comment: In plants and animals, dormancy may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. In plants, dormancy may involve the formation of dormant buds, and may be preceded by the senescence of plant parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system in herbaceous perennials. The exit from dormancy in vascular plants is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium.

The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."

Includes as subclasses fruit formation stage (PO:0025501) and fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). May have as part a seed development stage (PO:0001170). This stage applies to an individual fruit. For development stages of a whole plant (PO:0000003) based on fruit development, use whole plant fruit development stage (PO:0025500) or its subclasses.

comment: A lemma (PO:0009037) and palea (PO:0009038) enclose an individual spikelet floret (PO:0009082). The palea is usually the smaller of the two. Since it is not clear what the lemma and palea correspond to in conventional flowers, no assumptions of homology are made.

comment: An inflorescence is a reproductive shoot system from which at least two flowers develop. The growth pattern of an inflorescence may be monopodial (single main shoot axis), sympodial (growth only occurs from axillary meristems), or both. An inflorescence axis (PO:0020122) can be determinate or indeterminate. An inflorescence flower pedicel (PO:0009052) is the ultimate axis in an inflorescence. The flower (PO:0009046) of many plants, for example Magnolia spp., is solitary.

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophyte development stage but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002). A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophyte development stage, but not in the case of apospory. A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exist by death at any point in its development. In seed plants, the whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exists through transformation, such as when pollen (PO:0025281) releases its pollen sperm cells (PO:0025121) or when a plant embryo (PO:0009009) begins to develop within an embryo sac (PO:0025074) of an angiosperm. During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes (PO:0025006) by mitosis.

For species with scaled buds, this is generally once the entire leaf blade has emerged from a breaking bud; for conifers, once a needle begins to spread away at an angle from the developing stem or from other needles in a bundle (e.g. pines); for grasses, once the leaf blade unrolls slightly from around the stem and begins to fall away at an angle; for sedges, once the leaf has grown long enough that the two halves of the blade have begun to spread apart like an open book; for rushes, once the exposed, green portion of the leaf has reached a specified length.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.
