This file contains the source term lists to create imports from external ontologies as well as the OWL import files generated by ODK. These OWL files get merged into the main file when there is a release.

This repo conversion is in process, so the *.txt files are the ones automatically generated by ODK and the .csv ones are the old files from the previous version. Ramona will convert the CSV files to TSV files and generate the actual imports.

I added COB here, even though we are currently not importing anything. Once the ODK conversion is complete, I will make another new release that replaces BFO root terms with COB terms.
