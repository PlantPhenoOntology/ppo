This file contains the owl modules generated by ROBOT that get imported into ppo.owl. In the case of PPO, these are the files that don't fit a DOSDP pattern.

The owl files here are the blank ones generated by ODK. Once the [templates](../templates) are finished, I'll generate the real OWL files using ODK.

Trait classes and trait present and absent classes are generated using DOSDP.
