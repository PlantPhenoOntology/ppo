PPO:0002002	class	abscised plant structure presence	PPO:0002002	plant phenological trait	A plant phenological trait}that is measured by the number of some plant structure that a whole plant has abscised.				The number can be 0 or more.	
PPO:0002007	class	seedling presence	PPO:0002007	plant structure presence	A plant phenological trait that is measured by whether or not a whole plant is a seedling.

The number can be 0 or more.	
PPO:0002060	class	abscised cone or seed presence	PPO:0002060	abscised plant structure presence	 A plant phenological trait that is measured by the number of a whole plant's ripe seed cones that have been abscised or removed by an herbivore and/or the number of ripe seed cones on a whole plant that have abscised at least one mature seed.				The number can be 0 or more and only includes the most recent cone crop.
